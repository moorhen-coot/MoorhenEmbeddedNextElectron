This app is an example of embedding the [Moorhen](https://github.com/moorhen-coot/Moorhen) molecular graphics program into a NextJS Electron app.

It is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This is only tested on Mac.

# Moorhen Embedded in Electron/NextJS

```bash
npm install
npm run make-mac
```

The open the created `Moorhen.app` somewhere in the `out` directory.

You can start tweaking this example app by modifying `src/app/WrappedMoorhen.tsx`. The page usually auto-updates as you edit the file.
